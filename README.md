* Sets a faster key repeat rate.
* Downloads and installs Sparta fonts, and rebuilds the font cache.
* Downloads and applies the `SpartaPro.terminal` theme.

    - libyaml
    - ctags
    - git
    - vim
    - heroku-toolbelt
    - hub
    - imagemagick
    - curl
    - chromedriver
    - httpie
    - node
    - rbenv
    - ruby-build

* Configures rbenv to `install` `bundler`, `brice`, `gist`, `pry`, `pry-doc`, `awesome_print`, `specific_install` with every new ruby installation.
* Installs the latest ruby version available from rbenv, and sets it globally.
* Updates all system gems and configures bundler to use parallel installation.

* Removes all default items from the dock, switches on magnification and adds Google Chrome, Atom, Mail and Slack to the dock.
* Runs a macOS Software Update.
* Builds the `locate` database.
* Clones the Sparta Workstation VM into `~/sparta/workstation`, configures it and provisions the vagrant box.
* Shuts down the Vagrant Box and restarts the machine.

### Todo

* Split into multiple Scripts
    - Config: Basic config stuff and all the curl stuff
    - Install: Homebrew and all the Apps
    - VM: The VM installation
    - Cleanup: All the required cleanup
* Add check to each section to only run them if needed, to allow multiple runs.
* Build second script to reset laptops to initial state:
    - Remove all rubies and gems
    - Remove all brew installed packages
    - Remove homebrew
    - Clear downloads, home directory etc
    - Empty Trash
    - Empty Applications folder of all but default Gems
    - Clear Safari Browsing History
    - Reset as many macOS settings as possible
